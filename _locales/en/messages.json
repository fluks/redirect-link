Right square brackets must be escaped in the regex. E.g. https://%r[[a-z.\\]+]/\n%g[N] - Capturing group from EnableURL field, where N is the index of captured group.\n\nDue to Chrome's API changes you can't use same formats as before for Always redirects. You can reference up to 9 capture groups in redirect URL from EnableURL. Example: https://\\1.fi/\\2"
